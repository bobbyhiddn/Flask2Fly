# Modules Directory

The `modules` directory is a key component of the Flask-Fly Framework's modular architecture, designed to support extensible functionality through Git submodules.

## Purpose

This directory serves as the container for additional functionality modules that can be integrated into the main application. By using Git submodules, teams can:
- Maintain separate codebases for different features
- Share functionality across multiple projects
- Control versioning independently for each module
- Scale the application by adding new features modularly

## Structure

The modules directory follows this structure:
```
modules/
└── pages/
    └── [additional module directories]
```

Each module should:
- Be maintained as a separate Git repository
- Include its own documentation
- Follow the framework's architectural principles
- Maintain clear separation between routing and business logic

## Implementation

To add a new module:
1. Create a new Git repository for your module
2. Add it as a submodule to this directory
3. Update the main application to integrate the module's functionality

## Best Practices

When developing modules:
- Keep modules focused on specific functionality
- Maintain independent version control
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Follow the framework's design philosophy regarding separation of concerns
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Include appropriate tests

## Module Management

The framework provides utility scripts in the `utils` directory to help manage modules:
- `git_update.sh`: Manages submodule updates
- `setup.sh`: Helps with initial module setup
